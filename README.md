This projetc just write from my problem in my work.

my company build web app with tomcat,many project and many place.
when they create a new project,they copy the exist project,and change web domain name in web.xml and sqlserver host in jdbc.properties side by side(yet..about 10 web app in one project).they set localhost for test,and set web domain name for release.

because no scripe,no version control system like git,they do same and boring work every day.but I think,I should not spend time at what the computer can do by itself,so write this project,help me get out for same and boring working.
